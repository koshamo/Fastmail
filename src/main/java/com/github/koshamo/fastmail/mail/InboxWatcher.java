/**
 * The InboxWatcher is used to check, if new mails have arrived to the mail box
 * and also notifies us, when an email has been deleted from elsewhere.
 * <p>
 * InboxWatcher and FolderSynchronizer are very similar, but currently have
 * different purposes and thus specializations:
 * <p>
 * InboxWatcher only checks for new mails and adds them to the local 
 * mail list and notifies the user of newly arrived mails, whereas 
 * FolderSynchronizer checks the folder and the local mail list, if any
 * differences exists and updates the local list.
 * <p>
 * Currently we use both tasks, as we can define different periods for both 
 * tasks to check the server folder. Maybe it would be a great idea to 
 * integrate InboxWatcher into FolderSynchronizer and leave this class.
