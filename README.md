# Fastmail
Fast Java Mail Client

Fastmail is a Java Email Client, that uses 
JavaMail ( https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home )
for email connection to server. The GUI is build using JavaFX.

I wrote this peace of software as I had been in need of a new Email client for
my new Laptop. The available Email clients didn't fit my needs so I decided to write
one to suit my needs.

I am developing on FreeBSD using OpenJDK. 
So please provide me with feedback for other platforms and compilers.


Version history:
please see HISTORY file

Project roadmap:
please see ROADMAP file

Current status:
I currently refactor the architecture of this mail client to get a better 
basis for more features as the GUI code and mail code currently are coupled
to strong. The development is done in branch 'refactoring', but not always
runnable. So please be patient for the next release.
